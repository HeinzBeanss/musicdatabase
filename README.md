# musicdatabase
A place to learn and practice PHP with a database such as MySQL.

Here I hope to learn the basic of PHP, and after familiarising myself with them, I hope to incorporate the use of a database so I can understand how to more effectively query using Structured Query Language.

For this project, it's going to be a simple web application where I can view, edit, add, or delete music such as Songs, Albums, and Artists.
You can also sign in as a user with a unique email and password, and whilst logged in you can create your own personal playlist unique to you.

Skills and concepts tackled during the creation of this project:

- Understanding and changing the Document Root.
- Setting up an SQL Database (MySql)
- CRUD Operations
- Debugging improvements
- Classes, and their properties and methods, and $this
- Static keyword (and self)
- Access Modifiers
- Namespaces
- Compartmentalisation
- Vanilla custom routing
- Sessions
- Session Flashing
- Authentication
- Hashing and hashing passwords
- Sanitization and Validation (Preventing SQL Injections)
- Custom Middleware
- Autoloading
- Composer Basics
- Using the PRG (Post, Redirect, Get) Standard
- Directory standards - public and app

It's very rough, but it's all to begin and apply a solid foundation of PHP Basics and to get accustomed to specific PHP practices. This way when moving on to Laravel shortly, I can understand things properly and progress rapidly, and thoroughly.
