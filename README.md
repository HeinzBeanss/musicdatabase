# musicdatabase
A place to learn and practice PHP with a database such as MySQL.

Here I hope to learn the basic of PHP, and after familiarising myself with them, I hope to incorporate the use of a database so I can understand how to more effectively query using Structured Query Language.

For this project, it's going to be a simple web application where I can view, edit, add, or delete music such as Songs, Albums, and Artists.
